# Images in HTML
You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box. <br />
The float property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image, New classes are created with names such as align-left or align-right to align the images.
<br />
By default, images are inline elements. This means that they flow within the surrounding text. In order to center an image, it should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display property with a value of block.
<br />
Once it has been made into a block-level element, there are two common ways in which you can horizontally center an image: <br />
1. On the containing element, you can use the text-align property with a value of center.
2. On the image itself, you can use the use the margin property and set the values of the left and right margins to auto.
<br />
The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.
<br />
**Background images are often the last thing on the page to load (which can make a website seem slow to load.**
<br />
The background-repeatproperty can have four values: <br />
1. repeat: The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically (the default way it is shown if the backgroundrepeat property isn't used).
2. repeat-x: The image is repeated horizontally only (as shown in the first example on the left).
3. repeat-y: The image is repeated vertically only.
4. no-repeat: The image is only shown once.
5. Fixed: The background image stays in the same position on the page.
6. Scroll: The background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page.
<br />
### Background Position 
When an image is not being repeated, you can use the background-position property to specify where in the browser window the background image should be placed. This property usually has a pair of values. The first represents the horizontal position and the second represents the vertical.
<br />
**Rollover:  create a link or button that changes to a second style when a user moves their mouse over it.** <br />
CSS3 is going to introduce the ability to specify a gradient for the background of a box. The gradient is created using the background-image property and, at the time of writing, different browsers required a different syntax. <br />
To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites.
