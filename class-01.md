# How Pages Use Structure
## Structuring Word Documents
Structure helps readers understand the stories in the newspaper, the use of headings and subheadings in any document often reflects a hierarchy of information. For example, a document might start with a large heading, followed by an introduction or the most important information. This might be expanded upon under subheadings lower down on the page.<br />
So, we use HTML to describe the Structure of Pages to describe the structure in HTML we use Elements, each element of them has open and closing tag. <br />
Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content, the closing tag denotes the end.<br />
Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.<br />
And we have Attributes which provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign. <br />
The attribute name indicates what kind of extra information you are supplying about the element's content. The value is the information or setting for the attribute. It should be placed in double quotes. Different attributes can have different values, an example of attribute is “href”.<br />
* The body element everything will be inside this element.
* The head element contains information about the page and will  be shown in the main browser as a highlighted text.
* The title element the content will be shown in the top of the browser as a headline of the site.

 ## The Evolution of HTML 
there have been several different versions of HTML, HTML 4 , HTML 1.0 and HTML 5 . So we use ‘doctypes ‘to declare the type of html we use and mainly to tell the browser the version of html the page is using,we can make comments in html by adding our comment inside  <!—These  --> .

We can identify elements within other elements so we can style them uniqly from other similar elements:<br />
1. we can use id attribute to identify one element only from others.
2. we can user class attribute to identify group of elements from others.

# Grouping Text and elements in a Block

* Div Element: allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box , or you might create a div element to contain comments from visitors and will make it easier follow up with your code.

* Span element: acts like an inline equivalent of the div element. It is used to either:<br />
 a) Contain a section of text where there is no other suitable.<br />
b) Contain a number of inline elements.
So that we can control the appearance of the content of these elements using CSS.

* iframe element:  is like a little window that has been cut into your page and in that window you can see another page, like cutting google maps to identify a location of your company.
* Meta element: lives inside the head element and contains information about that web page. It is not visible to users but fulfills a number of purposes such as telling search engines about your page, who created it, and whether or not it is time sensitive. The meta element is an empty element so it does not have a closing tag. It uses attributes to carry the information.


# HTML5 Layout
* The header and footer elements can be used for: the main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
*  The nav element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.
*  The article  element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated
* The aside element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an article element or not.<br />
1. When the aside element is used inside an article element, it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning.
2. When the aside element is used outside of an article element, it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page.
* The section element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.

# Process and Design
To start with your website you should ask yourself questions to understand your audience and to present information to users in the right way. 
So you can start with 
-	Who is the site for?  To design the site for the audience like individuals or companies.
-	Why people Visit my website? To know the visitors and what they are coming for.
-	What information they need? So you can achieve there goals effectively 
-	Site maps: so you can start to organize the information into sections or pages.
-	Wireframes: A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.

 ***Designing navigation should be concise, clear and selective.***

# The ABC of Programming
Script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal, to write a script you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.
Computers approach tasks in a different way than  humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically.
You should Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.
## objects and properties
In computer programming, each physical thing in the world can be represented as an object, Each object can have its own:<br />
• Properties: tell us about the object<br />
• Events: perform tasks using the proprties of the object.<br />
• Methods: how people interact with an object in the real world.
